This presentation will focus on the uses of R in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), including graphics for labels, Bayesian designs and analyses, simulations, machine learning, data quality and data integrity efforts, as well as interactive visualizations using R Shiny. Some of the challenges with using R will be discussed, as well as advantages of using R to collaborate with colleagues in industry and academe through Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), Broad Agency Agreements (BAAs), and working groups associated with professional societies (ASA, DIA, PhUSE)."

SAS has long been the de-facto standard for analyzing data in a regulated GxP environment. Web deployment of these applications has been the best approach, and Pfizer VRD has developed several mid-tier applications in Java that submit batch SAS processes on a High Performance Computing grid. Pfizer VRD’s high level approach is the same across different assay platforms data are pulled from a combination of electronic files and Oracle databases and analyzed, results are written back to an Oracle database, and electronic output files are made in various formats (e.g. PDF). The regulated nature of Pfizer VRD’s work and the difficulty in deploying R-based applications over the web have previously been an impediment to the use of R, but new tools such as RStudio’s Shiny Server Pro have helped us overcome those challenges. This presentation focuses on a comparison of the architecture used to deploy our SAS applications and the infrastructure required to deploy R-based applications to meet GxP requirements. Real life examples will be provided to illustrate the usefulness of this platform in a regulated laboratory environment."
"rinpharma_9","2018 Conference","Talk","2018","2018-08-15","Chase Clark","University of Illinois","IDBac: A New Paradigm in Developing Microbial Libraries for Drug Discovery","https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/blob/master/talks_folder/2018-Clark-IDBac.pdf","","The success of a bacterial drug discovery program can be no greater than the phylogenetic diversity and capacity of those bacteria in the library to produce specialized metabolites (SM). However, the methods used to create bacterial strain libraries have seen little innovation in nearly 80 years. Current practice relies entirely on colony morphology and/or 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis to decide which isolated strains to retain for addition to a drug discovery library. However, these practices create inefficient libraries plagued with a high degree of taxonomic and chemical redundancy by relying on physical characteristics that have limited correlation with strains’ SM, the foundation of drug discovery. Therefore, the development of a platform to rapidly prioritize unknown bacterial strains based on phylogeny and SM would greatly increase the efficiency of the front-end of microbial drug discovery. Our lab has recently developed such a platform, called IDBac, which uses in situ matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to analyze protein and specialized metabolite spectra of single bacterial colonies. Utilizing R and Shiny, alongside state-of-the-art packages and techniques in MALDI processing and data visualization, we created a stand-alone executable program for MALDI-TOF MS bacterial analysis. Using unsupervised learning methods and visualizations we have demonstrated IDBac’s capabilities by creating protein and specialized metabolite MS profiles, generating protein MS hierarchical groupings that accurately mirrored phylogenetic groupings and further distinguishing isolates based on inter- and intra-species differences in specialized metabolite production. With the ease of use of modern MALDI instrumentation and interactive, intuitive data exploration, IDBac can rapidly profile up to 384 bacteria in 4 hours. To our knowledge, IDBac is the first attempt to couple in situ MS analyses of protein content and specialized metabolite production and will enable laboratories with access to a MALDI-TOF MS the ability to rapidly create more efficient libraries for their drug discovery programs."

"rinpharma_13","2018 Conference","Talk","2018","2018-08-15","Juliane Manitz","EDM Serono","Multi-state Model for the Analysis of an Association between Safety and Efficacy Events","https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/blob/master/talks_folder/2018-Manitz-Association_between_Safety_and_Efficacy_Events.pdf","","Safety and efficacy data in clinical trials are mostly analyzed separately. However, especially the treatment of life-threatening disease such as cancer requires a good understanding of benefit and associated risks to make an informed therapy decision for an individual patient. Recently approved immunotherapeutic drugs in oncology are associated with potential side effects such as immune-related hypothyroidism, rash and colitis. There is some biological reasoning that the occurrence of immune-related adverse events and corresponding management may compromise the drug response. On the other hand, it has been observed that patients responding to treatment might face a higher likelihood of adverse drug reactions. A multi-state model is able to explore these hypotheses and offers the opportunity of insights into potential associations while addressing some of the methodological challenges. For example, the necessity of a time-dependent approach to accommodate the fact that safety and efficacy events can occur throughout the treatment. Moreover, longer treatment duration can impact simultaneously the likelihood of efficacy as well as safety events, i.e., introducing immortal time bias. The multistate model is able to unfold this spurious correlation. We present an approach for analysis and exemplify the methodology with simulated data."

"rinpharma_16","2018 Conference","Talk","2018","2018-08-15","Lindsay Rutter","Iowa State University","Visualization methods for RNA-sequencing data analysis","","","RNA-seq data is biased and accurate detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is not a trivial task. While the data collection can be considered high-throughput, data analysis has intricacies that require careful human attention. The most effective approach to modern data analysis is to iterate between models and visuals, and to enhance the appropriateness of models based on feedback from visuals. As it stands, there is a need to make it easier for scientists and clinicians to use models and visuals in a complimentary fashion during RNA-seq data analysis. Here, we use public RNA-seq data to show that our visualization tools can detect normalization problems, DEG designation problems, and common errors in RNA-seq analysis. We also show that our tools can identify genes of interest that cannot be obtained with models. Through this project, we propose that users slightly modify their approach to data analysis by quickly assessing the sensibility of their models with statistical graphics. We plan to publish a new R software package that includes the plotting techniques introduced in this project, which can be useful for exploring several types of multivariate biological data such as RNA-sequencing data."

Eudy-Byrne","Metrum Research Group","The Use of R in the Development of Physiological Model for Healthy Growth","https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/blob/master/talks_folder/2018-Byrne-Physiological_Model_for_Healthy_Growth.html","","A physiologically-based mathematical model was developed as a series of ordinary differential equations to describe compositional changes (in fat and fat-free mass, FM & FFM) due to metabolizable energy exchanges in babies from birth to 2 years in low-to-middle income countries.1 The objective of this work was to identify potential biomarkers for future intervention studies, identify when to intervene to protect and/or rescue growth in individuals suffering from malnutrition, and to identify which of these individuals would be more or less likely to respond to a nutritional intervention. A translation of this model (155 parameters and 26 compartments) using R and the open-source mrgsolve package2 provided an efficient platform for multi-parameter optimization, as required during additional model development and for subsequent simulations. For comparison, a 8.62 seconds simulation with viral and bacterial infections (no interventions) in the R/mrgsolve implementation required 226 seconds in Matlab. Model translation to R also enabled simulations with a Shiny App, allowing users to simulate individual infant phenotypes and infection events and visualize growth and energy levels over time, relative to healthy (WHO) standards. The model currently also includes a relatively simple implementation of persistent antibiotic therapy with a potential for inclusion of drug exposure-related effects, i.e. - through a pharmacokinetic (PK) model, to describe effects of antiviral or antibiotic therapy. The challenge to this development is the scarcity of available data describing this therapy in malnourished children that would be needed for model calibration. Further development of the model includes linking to other systems models such Mother-fetus energy exchange or PBPK mother-fetus models, to enable simulations of growth beginning at gestation."

This enables diversification of Ab portfolio and insures back up options if Ab candidate fails. However, there was no method or software available in-house to support Ab discovery with capacities to apply biophysical rules to classify the sequences. Shiny app ""Group My Abs"" was developed to apply biophysical properties for Ab characterization to the NGS data. Several Multiple Sequence Alignment algorithms implemented in the app enable sequence comparability. A method was developed to evaluate differences between comparable sequences and subsequently classify sequences into families. The app provides custom-made and interactive data visualization, enables refined Ab classification in a mathematical manner, considerably increases efficiency and insures reproducibility. This all decreases bias and enables informative decision making during the hit-to-lead stage in biologics drug discovery."

At Novartis, Shiny and markdown have gained a lot of popularity in analyzing, visualizing and reporting of clinical trial data. Traditional report analysis plan (RAP) process was designed to create static table, figure and listings. In this talk, I will use ShinyRAP (a shiny app) to illustrate a novel framework/workflow of planning and executing of both pre-specified and ad-hoc analyses, as well as building dynamic/interactive reports through R/Shiny/Markdown. The app features efficient and organized programming through meta-data and shiny modules, and dynamic display of results via multi-select, grouping and searching, etc. Although motivated from a clinical trial data context, this framework can also be used for other types of data."
"rinpharma_23","2018 Conference","Talk","2018","2018-08-15","Jun Li","Bristol Myers Squibb","Data-Driven Strategies for Synthetic Route Design and Operational Modeling within Pharmaceutical Development","","","Decision analysis balancing both data analytics and human gut feeling is critical in designing efficient routes to synthesize new, complex small molecules. This challenge is faced by any organization seeking to deliver modern pharmaceutical compounds to patients in a prompt manner. In this presentation, we highlight the incorporation of data science approaches using R to develop metrics that aid in the development process current complexity, risk quantification, and process efficiency forecasting. Current complexity is a metric established from human insights that assesses a molecule’s complexity in the context of capability, tracking the ‘current’ complexity of a given molecule over time and enabling the quantitative assessment of a new route or process. Risk quantification utilizes a Bayesian framework to quantify risk from real data and operational patterns, at both the project and portfolio level, for assessing the delivery risk of early candidate nomination assets in areas such as FTE resource modeling. Process efficiency can be estimated with a predictive analytics framework capable of quantifying the probable efficiency of a proposed synthesis or benchmarking the outcome performance of the developed process, thereby minimizing the environmental impact of pharmaceutical production. These strategies have been effectively used to aid the decision-making processes for pharmaceutical R&D."

Therefore, new causal inference methods that combine ideas from machine learning and causal inference may improve analysis of these studies by taking advantage of the wealth of information measured in claims. In order to evaluate the performance of these methods as applied to claims-based studies, we use a combination of real data examples and plasmode simulation, implemented in R package ‘plasmode’, which creates realistic simulated datasets based on a real cohort study. In this talk, I will give an overview of our progress so far and what is left to be done."

We do this by creating technical infrastructure in the form of carefully vetted, staff- and community-contributed R software tools that lower barriers to working with scientific data sources on the web. We have developed a highly successful model for peer review of scientific software that provides transparent, constructive and collegial review of R packages. Our community is our best asset. We are building social infrastructure in the form of a welcoming and diverse community. rOpenSci.org hosts blog posts by authors and reviewers of onboarded packages to share both functionality and lessons learned; we promote these on social media to bring their work to a wider audience. Our discussion forum, community calls and annual hackathon-flavored unconference are designed to share best practices and to build a trust network for the often challenging discussions about doing research more reproducibly."

This capability has obvious applications in pharma, as it lets R users build interactive apps for their collaborators to explore models or results, or to automate workflows. However, the interactivity of Shiny apps is a double-edged sword, as it introduces challenges to the traceability and reproducibility of your analysis. To use interactive applications in pharma responsibly, these challenges must be addressed.

This transition was driven by industry-wide acknowledgement of the growing importance of leveraging analytics to support PHC, but this change necessitated radical changes in workflows and competencies. To adapt to this change, the team has moved from using a single proprietary software (SAS) to becoming an open source-focused, R based but increasingly programming language agnostic, department. A core driver of this transition was the development of an internal suite of R packages that handled markdown templates and database access through to wrappers for common plots and documenting git hashes of all code used.

With input from experienced practitioners, we have built an interactive tool to allow individuals to build complex recruitment models using the R/Shiny framework. The Tool Enhance R, our platform for study modeling, was ported from an Excel-based tool to the R/Shiny platform to increase model development speed, expand capability and drive transparency into model development. The tool allows users to specify critical model attributes (i.e. country site distribution, recruitment/activation rates, country-specific vacations), and provide instantaneous feedback that changes have on a model’s probability of success. Using the RStudio Connect platform, we are able to grant multi-level access to users through a single web interface. Model development is tracked by exporting results to a SharePoint site and logging versions for future review/auditing. This gives significant levels of transparency on how a model was created and evolved over time. For web analytics, we used Piwik, and internal web analytics platform, to monitor how users navigate through the platform and identify browsing behavior. The application was built upon the Shiny Dashboard framework and leverages many visualization packages, including Plotly, Timevis, ggplot2 and many more. Many challenges arose in its develop, from controlling over-zealous user clicks causing out of control execution, to integrating service account execution of apps to facilitate centralized data control.

The process of developing SDTM involves mapping captured raw data to their correspondent SDTM domains based on rules and conditions put by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) organization. SDTM data is further used for building the Analysis Data Model (ADaM) which is used for clinical trial statistical analysis. Mistakes in the mapping process are common due to the process complexities; issues that are missed may potentially affect the clinical trial result. Therefore, it is very essential to preserve the quality of the SDTM data. Currently, the main tool for checking SDTM conformance is Pinnacle21 (formerly known as OpenCDISC). Notably, there are usability and viability checks that are not included in Pinnacle21. This work describes the creation of an R shiny app to supplement the Pinnacle21 checks. This interactive app applies various CDISC-compliant SDTM data validation checks, and provides the user with a comprehensive report on possible inconsistencies in the data. The app would allow programmers to proactively find data mapping errors. In addition, it is straightforward to use and can save tremendous amounts of time. Additionally, this app’s audience extends beyond the programming community and covers other individuals who have an interest in data quality, particularly Data Managers and individuals in Clinical Science and Clinical Operations."

Unfortunately, often an analysis cannot be reproduced and therefore its computational methodology and merit are unknown. Often, the data, code, or description of computational methods is not maintained. In order to implement good practices of reproducible computational research, the leadership of the company must invest time and resources into planning, training, ensuring adoption of common practices and tools, implementing documentation systems, encouraging discipline on the individual and group level, creating incentives, and requiring accountability. At Eisai, we have developed a working system for reproducible computational research that is enabled by leadership, technology, and culture. With regards to technology, we primarily use Rmarkdown and R Notebooks on an Rstudio server used by all our analysts. The Rstudio server is maintained by an administrator who installs packages for all users, creating a common package environment that ensures that code can be rerun in the future. Data and code are stored in a shared network drive and version control is accomplished by using Git. A wiki that is editable by all analysts is used to organize all analyses (tracked with unique analysis IDs) and provides links to code and results. With regards to culture, the leadership has promoted the values of quality and reproducibility. When yearly objectives are set, the performance criteria includes the creation of analysis documents (e.g. Rmarkdown reports), use of version control, and organization of data on shared network drives. Setting aside time for wiki documentation in the midst of high demands from project teams is helped by having periodic “documentation day” parties. To verify reproducibility, we have implemented ""witnessing"" once the analysis is finished, it is reviewed by an independent team member who officially signs off on the work, stating that the reproducibility criteria have been met. Our success in implementing reproducible computational research can serve as a model for other companies to use. Here we have provided a model based on leadership, technology, and culture."

Additionally, in reviewing Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA), FDA reviewers often analyze safety studies and perform various kinds of simulations. A growing, vibrant group of statisticians in the Office of Biostatistics, CDER/FDA has adopted R for both their routine tasks and to address numerous scientific questions that are received in the form of internal consults. During the past 5 years, we have used R to run power simulations; generate the distribution of certain statistics of interest; assess the similarity of and cluster amino-acid sequences as well as, derive the distribution of the molecular weight of such sequences of a certain length; and determine the validity of data sets categorized for genotoxicity. R-package SABE was developed to accompany a new statistical test, used to assess BE of topical dermatological products when data for evaluation come from the In-Vitro Permeation Test (IVPT) [1]. BE tests consider comparisons between a Test (usually generic) and a Reference (RLD) product under a replicate study design. A function that assesses BE of a Test and a Reference formulation uses a mixed scaled criterion for the PK metrics AUC (Area Under the Curve) and Cmax (maximum concentration)."

This can happen due to tight timelines, lack of ready-to-use graphic tools or enthusiasm for complex models. Exploratory plots can help to uncover useful insights in the data and identify aspects to be explored further through modeling or in future studies. Exploratory plots can even quickly answer questions without the need of a complex model, improving our efficiency and providing timely impact on project strategy. The Exploratory Graphics (xGx) tool is an open-source R-based tool, freely available on GitHub [1]. Intuitively organized by datatype and driven by analysis questions, the tool aims to encourage a question-based approach to data exploration focusing on the key questions relevant to dose-exposure-response analyses. Objectives - Facilitate the purposeful exploration of PKPD data - Encourage a question-based approach to data exploration, focusing on dose-exposure-response relationships - Provide a teaching tool for people new to PKPD analysis Methods PK (single and multiple ascending dose), and PD (continuous, time-to-event, categorical, count, and ordinal) data were simulated and formatted according to a typical PKPD modeling dataset format. Lists of key questions relevant to dose-exposure-response exploration were compiled, and exploratory plots were generated to answer each question. The graphs were created following good graphics principles to ensure quality and consistency in our graphical communications [2]. Results Examples of the key analysis questions include - Provide an overview of the data - What type of data is it (e.g. continuous, binary, categorical)? - How many doses? - What is the range of doses explored? - For PK data, how many potential compartments are observed? - Is the exposure dose-proportional? - Is there evidence of nonlinearity in clearance? - Assess the variability - How large is the between subject variability compared to between dose separation? - Can any of the between subject variability be attributed to any covariates? - Are there any patterns in the within subject variability (e.g. circadian rhythms, seasonal effects, food effects, underlying disease progression)? - Assess the dose/exposure-response relationship - Is there evidence of a correlation between dose/exposure and response? - Is the relationship positive or negative? - Is there a plateau or maximal effect in the observed dose/exposure range? - Is there evidence of a delay between exposure and response? For each datatype in the simulated dataset, plots were generated to answer these key questions. The plots along with the codes to produce them were compiled into a user friendly interface. The tool is intuitively organized by datatype and driven by the analysis questions. Since the graphs were generated based on a typical modeling dataset format and hosted online, they can be easily accessed and applied to new projects. Conclusion Exploratory plots were generated, built around typical key questions particularly relevant to dose-exposure-response exploration and compiled into a user friendly interface. The Exploratory Graphics (xGx) tool can help underscore the role of purposeful data exploration for quantitative scientists. Through a question-based approach, xGx helps uncover useful insights that can be revealed without complex modeling and identify aspects of the data that may be explored further.

Shiny is an open source R package that facilitates the development of user-friendly, web-based applications. The Pharmaceutical Users Software Exchange (PhUSE) consortium has provided a platform for stakeholders throughout the pharmaceutical industry to collaboratively build and share tools, e.g. R Shiny applications, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of drug development. The modeling of standard repeat-dose toxicology study endpoints, e.g. body weights, clinical signs, clinical pathology, histopathology, toxicokinetics, etc., in SEND has created new opportunities for dynamic, interactive visualization of study data above and beyond the static tables and figures typically included in static study reports. For example, clinical pathology data from nonclinical toxicology studies can be difficult to digest when presented as group means in data tables, due to the large number of potentially correlated analytes collected across treatment groups, sexes, and potentially multiple timepoints. An R Shiny application has been developed to allow end users to comprehensively examine these datasets, using a variety of analytical and visualization methods, with relative ease. The application is publicly hosted on shinyapps.io, and the source code can be found on the PhUSE GitHub website."

More recently, this paradigm has shifted to match modern software development principles, transitioning toward continuous monitoring of software validation and quality. I'll share our developing perspectives on validation and reproducibility, driven by a need to leverage open source tools. This vision leans on open source software such as R and its package ecosystems, publicly maintained containerized environments like the rocker project and cross-industry risk assessment via the R Validation Hub. By treating analysis as a software process in the content pipeline transforming raw data into analytic results, we can take advantage of the continuous deployment workflows prevalent in the software development world to shorten our filing timelines, while simultaneously delivery a more reproducible product to our health authority partners."

Some authors have pointed out that a large portion of published research findings is incorrect and/or irreproducible. Some state that the medical literature is as reliable as expected. Despite the true state of the research literature, we can agree that reproducibility is of greatest importance to biomarker detection, including in the context of drug discovery and development. Research reproducibility may become a challenge in the current research community, because of the interdisciplinary nature of modern studies and latent gaps between the advancement of technology and the ability to analyze the resulting data. In this presentation, we will describe the reproducibility challenges of biomarker detection in liquid biopsies, which hold prevalent promises in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Our study shows that proper development and use of R packages can give a significant contribution to reproducible, high-quality, and cutting-edge research in nucleic acid biomarker detection, such as detection of novel circulating microRNA biomarkers."

Appropriate study design, data analyses and interpretation are essential in providing the knowledge about the drug efficacy and safety within a living organism. With drug discovery science moving forward at an ever-accelerating rate data analyses software are not always capable to offer appropriate toolset for data analyses. In the absence of a proper tool, oncology in vivo scientists at Janssen R&D needed comprehensive analysis platform to conduct appropriate and efficient analyses of in vivo data to insure quality and speed of decision-making.

Methods ModViz POP has an in built PKPD ODE library of models based on the compartmental nomenclature for simulating standard IV bolus, infusion and first order absorption scenarios. It also gives the user the ability to plug in a model from local directory to quickly simulate a model of interest. Users can also simulate from a project library which serves as a repository of final PK/PD models developed by individual project teams. Beyond the PK/PD models, it can handle complex QSP models and PBPK models equally well. Enhanced R packages, HTML/CSS, LATEX in combination with Shiny were used and provided an elegant and powerful programming framework for turning models into a web application with dynamic visualization and automated report writing. The user interface consists of several key inputs for performing the simulations. A tabbed navigation allows the user to visualize the plots, input parameters, derived values and equations. It provides the ability to download the underlying model, plots, simulated data or a comprehensive report consisting of all the key inputs and outputs of the simulations. The Help button provides a link to documentation with detailed instructions on different components of the interface. The interface also includes advanced features where users can overlay external data on over simulated data, set a certain simulation scenario as a reference or carry out sensitivity analysis based simulations. Conclusions This easy to use interface can serve as a valuable tool for teams to explore and evaluate potential scenarios and thus facilitate collaborative decision making in the drug discovery and development paradigm.

At the same time, the number of R packages to be installed grows exponentially with each new package added. Their complex dependencies may create conflicts. In this context, the R admin is often confronted with a cohort of packages without knowing the package of interest. We use statistical analysis techniques from the field of complex network analysis in order to shed light into the non-trivial dependency structures of package cohorts. Furthermore, we simplify the network graph to find improved installation sequences for a pre-selected cohorts of R packages. We reduce large package cohorts to a sufficient shortlist of packages, whose installation automatically pulls in other packages via dependencies without causing conflicts. The build time of a library may be greatly reduced. As a byproduct, we generate a graph of the build on the exact dependency tree and actual versions used for auditing and change control in the regulated workflows. This strategy also allows for the identification of high-risk packages and their importance in the dependency tree."

Compared to rule/algorithm-based designs such as the 3+3 design, model-based designs have the advantage of being more flexible in choosing the target toxicity rate and cohort size. Bayesian modeling allows to combine prior knowledge of the drug (e.g. from animal tox studies, data from comparator drugs or data from other studies) with the observed data from the current trial. The model-based approach accounts for uncertainty, optimize dose recommendations (balance of risk versus benefit for patients) and allows for dose de-escalation as well as dose re-escalation. Recent research has shown that model-based approaches are more reliable in estimating the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and allocating less patients to ineffective or excessively toxic doses (Jaki et al., 2019 [2]). Because of their higher complexity, model-based designs are still seen critical among clinicians (Le Tourneau et al., 2012 [3]), thus the classical 3+3 design is still widely implemented due to its simplicity and transparency. Conaway et al., 2019 [4] have highlighted that the choice of design in early phase affects the outcome of the drug development process, therefore more attention should be paid to early-stage designs. In this talk we will showcase how we bring Bayesian dose-escalation models closer to non-statisticians by means of R. We will discuss how we plan, implement and communicate the dose-escalation design to the clinicians. Moreover, we show how we present our results to the safety monitoring committee (SMC) and how we support the SMC in dose escalation decisions. We use a simple data example to illustrate the proposed methodology. All will be discussed within the context of using R as primary tool. [1] Iasonos, A. and O'Quigley, J (2014).

However, most PBPK applications have limited knowledge sharing impact because they are implemented in closed, proprietary software. Much of the physiologic data and knowledge required for these models is publically available or available in the pre-competitive space. To this end, we've engaged in the development of open science PBPK models, using R as the scaffolding for this work. In particular, our group has developed the mrgsolve R package which utilizes Rcpp to compile models of systems of ordinary differential equations. One example is the development of a PBPK model to predict maternal/fetal exposures for drugs that are primarily metabolized by liver CYP450 enzymes throughout pregnancy. This model aims to utilize a quantitative understanding of the physiological and biochemical changes that occur throughout pregnancy to inform clinical pharmacology decisions where clinical trials cannot. The model was validated against the observed data of 5 different drugs midazolam, metoprolol, caffeine, nevirapine, and artemether. A series of local sensitivity analyses followed by parameter optimization further improved model predictions using the mrgsolve and nloptr R packages. The developed maternal-fetal PBPK model in its flexible open-source implementation provides a transparent, platform-independent, and reproducible system for model-informed decision support while developing exposure-based dosing recommendations in maternal/fetal patient populations."

Housed within Fred Hutch, SCHARP is an instrumental partner in the research and clinical trials surrounding HIV prevention and vaccine development. Part of SCHARP's work involves analyzing experimental biomarkers and endpoints which change as the experimental question, analysis methods, antigens measured, and assays evolve. Maintaining a validated code base that is rigid in its output format, but flexible enough to cater a variety of inputs with minimal custom coding has proven to be important for reproducibility and scalability. SCHARP has developed several key steps in the creation, validation, and documentation of R packages that take advantage of R's packaging functionality. First, the programming team works with leadership to define specifications and lay out a roadmap of the package at the functional level. Next, statistical programmers work together and approach the task from a software development view. Once the code has been developed, the package is validated according to procedures that comply with 21 CFR part 11, and leverage software development life cycle (SDLC) methodology.

The tidy data paradigm provides a standard way to organise data values within a dataset, where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and data is manipulated using an easy-to-understand vocabulary. Most importantly, the data structure remains consistent across manipulation and analysis functions. We can achieve this for bulk RNA sequencing data with the tidybulk, tidyHeatmap and tidyverse packages. We will also touch on packages for tidy single-cell transcriptional analyses. These packages are part of the tidytranscriptomics suite that introduces a tidy approach to RNA sequencing data.

To safeguard patient safety, medical monitors need to review and explore raw safety data interactively, using standard visualizations as well as specific analyses tailored to the disease and the clinical study. The creation of semi-automated reports in R could facilitate this operation. The reports include interactive visualizations (with the plotly package) and interactive descriptive statistics tables and listings (with the DT package) for safety review of the patients. Template reports (based on Rmarkdown) incorporating standard analyses are integrated within an R package. The reports are set up via YAML configuration files to allow non-R users to customize the report for his/her specific study. Such report is created from datasets in CDISC standard SDTM or ADaM format, and delivered in the form of linked self-contained html pages. The creation of the report documentation (in the R package) and the validation of the input parameters in the config files is automated and provided with the JSON schema format.

Essentially, an MMRM is a specific linear mixed effects model that includes (at least) an interaction of treatment arm and categorical visit variables as fixed effects. The covariance structure of the residuals can have different forms, and often an unstructured (i.e. saturated parametrization) covariance matrix is preferred. This structure can be represented by random effects in the mixed model. All of this has typically been implemented in proprietary software, such as SAS, as its PROC MIXED routine is generally seen as a gold standard for mixed models. However, this does not allow the use of interactive web applications to explore the clinical study data in a flexible way. Furthermore, fitting such proprietary software into workflows such as automatic document generation is not convenient. Therefore, we wanted to implement MMRM in R. Several challenges had to be solved, such as finding the right R-packages for this purpose. We finally settled on {lme4} in combination with {lmerTest}, which could match results in SAS up to numerical precision. Convergence of estimates can be an issue and multiple optimization algorithms are therefore tried in parallel to enhance robustness. Extracting the covariance matrix estimate from {lme4} results was solved as well as finding model fit statistics that match SAS results. We use our own {rtables} to produce tables and {ggplot2} for plots. We developed a Shiny module in our internal framework for exploratory web applications. Further validation in the next months will allow us to use the R implementation for regulatory purposes, with greater flexibility and efficiency than before."

Housed within Fred Hutch, SCHARP is an instrumental partner in the research and clinical trials surrounding HIV prevention and vaccine development. Part of SCHARP's work involves analyzing experimental biomarkers and endpoints which change as the experimental question, analysis methods, antigens measured, and assays evolve. Maintaining a validated code base that is rigid in its output format, but flexible enough to cater a variety of inputs with minimal custom coding has proven to be important for reproducibility and scalability. SCHARP has developed several key steps in the creation, validation, and documentation of R packages that take advantage of R's packaging functionality. First, the programming team works with leadership to define specifications and lay out a roadmap of the package at the functional level. Next, statistical programmers work together to develop the package, taking advantage of the rich R ecosystem of packages for development such as roxygen2, devtools, usethis, and testthat. Once the code has been developed, the package is validated to ensure it passes all specifications using a combination of testthat and rmarkdown. Finally, the package is made available for use across the team on live data. These procedures set up a framework for validating assay processing packages that furthers the ability of Fred Hutch to provide world-class support for our clinical trials."

It instantly brought the attention of the pharmaceutical industry. Individual attempts to fulfil validation requirement and bring R to the controlled environments were made by a number of companies independently. In addition, combined efforts of the biggest pharmaceutical companies resulted in launching the R Validation Hub project. While most of the initiatives seem to focus on documentation and package quality assessment, relying on the results of unit tests delivered ""as is"" by the authors of R packages, we at 2KMM CRO set different priorities, driven by the importance of exhaustive numerical validation done in the first place. Without that, there is a risk that all the efforts on documentation and quality assurance will pertain to routines which results differ from those obtained with other trusted software in a way that cannot be adequately justified. While we do not undermine the importance of documentation and early unit testing, we believe that numerical validation, going far beyond running those tests, is mandatory to achieve satisfying level of reliability. We would like to share our findings in this area, including the choice of reference input data and results used during the validation, sources of discrepancies between R and other software, interpretation and acceptance of the results."

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency) is expanding its capacity for proactive pharmacovigilance of drug abuse, in addition to other drug safety signals. In post-market safety surveillance, pharmacy dispensing data provide valuable insights to the Agency for oversight of drug utilization. The drug dispensing data include the number of product dispensings aggregated over a time frame (e.g., months) by geographical locations (e.g., states, core-based statistical areas). One promising approach to enhance pharmacovigilance using these data would be through data enrichment geographically referenced public data sources covering detailed information on demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare service can be overlaid to proprietary, nationally projected data for prescription drug dispensing. Our project, funded by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Safety Research Interest Group (SRIG) program, seeks to develop a data analysis pipeline and software for generating real-world evidence (RWE) that will monitor changes in prescription opioid use and guide proactive pharmacovigilance of drug abuse. The software will provide tools to augment proprietary, nationally projected data for prescription drug dispensing with other geographically referenced, publicly available, demographic, socioeconomic, or healthcare service data.

Nested data frames are a powerful and flexible data structures that are well suited for these requirements. This talk will show how storing all of the steps of an analysis pipeline in a nested data frame allows analysts to utilize the well-established functionality of the tidyverse family of packages for efficient analysis and summarization of the data. It will also discuss how nested data frames are well suited for reproducibility and traceability, which are vital to documenting analytical performance. Reproducibility is often achieved by writing R notebooks in an environment that maintains package version consistency (e.g. docker, RStudio Server).

Due to the ease of development of Shiny apps and lack of complex examples, R developers often create a new shiny app in a single app.r file that contains both the ui and server code/ As a project grows, and capabilities expand in the app, a common practice is to separate the code into two files, one for the server object and one for the ui object. While these approaches may suffice for simple applications, they can lead a developer or team of developers down a path to an application with many lines of code (e.g. 15,000+) in a single file that can be extremely difficult to debug, test, maintain or expand. This approach can also lead to a file with a mixture of UI/server related code in the same files as complex computational code. In this talk, I will present the {PREP} (Packages fRom tEmPlates) package that was created to help teams streamline development of R Shiny apps and R packages using an approach that follows software development best practices. The PREP package adds new project types to R Studio to help streamline new project creation and development. There are three PREP project type options 1) a Shiny app as a package, 2) a Shiny app or 3) R package that is setup with the unit testing framework included utilizing {testthat} and is intended to contain all the complex computational functionality. Both Shiny app options are organized using modules with a consistent default theme, ability to switch between color theme options and example code for commonly implemented tasks. By developing the complex computations in the R packages and the Shiny app as separate projects, teams can utilize each person's skill set better and simplify the testing thus making a more robust final product. By developing the Shiny app with modules, teams can avoid extremely long single files and allow for sharing customized controls within different pages, make it much easier of using source control technology like GitHub. In addition, the PREP package includes functions to add new tabs and modules to the Shiny app and create new functions with testing setup in the computational package to avoid multiple steps of creating files for new functions and testing.

Several rounds of iterations between the main programmer and the validation programmer are usually needed to thoroughly explore the data. Furthermore, clinicians and statisticians often would like to explore the data themselves but lack a robust and flexible platform to carry out this data exploration. For instance, they may need to inspect an endpoint for patients with certain genetic markers, to analyze biomarker data, or to create table summaries. To meet these needs, we created tidyCDISC, an open source Shiny application that can be used to generate custom tables, statistics, and figures. The application has three modules a drag and drop table generator, a graphical population explorer, and a patient history explorer. We've taken a modularized approach to our package to ensure the application can be easily expanded upon to include further analyses and figures. By sharing our application as an open source solution, we hope to help other scientists with similar problems as well as promote collaboration in the pharmaceutical industry."

For the most part, most of these tables can be broken down into a few categories Counting for event based variables or categories, shifting to describe changes in state, and descriptive statistics to summarize continuous variables. For many of the tables that go into a clinical submission, at least when considering safety outputs, the tables are made up of a combination of these approaches. Consider a demographics table. When you look at the table, you can begin breaking the output down into smaller, redundant, components. These components can be viewed as 'layers', and the table as a whole is constructed by stacking those layers. Tplyr uses this concept to provide an intuitive framework to building clinical safety summaries."

With millions of screaming fans and selling over 600 million records, they are often cited as one of the most influential rock bands in history. One reason for their fame was their ability to communicate in the middle of songs without using words and without missing a single beat. This led me to consider some of the best collaborations I have been a part of, which are those where the team is in complete alignment and information flows easily from one team member to another. As analysts, it is our job to enhance the ability of teams to communicate with the best tool at our disposal; graphics. Just like Paul and John, our graphics need to communicate without speaking to convey information and help teams make critical decisions about clinical trials. Novartis leverages the potential of R - Shiny to develop interactive tools that engage users to explore their clinical trial data with ease. Although several programs have been impacted with this technology, the goal of reaching the entire drug development portfolio is still a work in progress. This talk will describe our experiences with R - Shiny with some examples. Finally, it should be stressed that creating effective Shiny Apps requires thought, as well as adherence to strong graphical principles. In this vein, we will provide and describe our Graphical Principles Cheat Sheet(TM) that covers many aspects and considerations one should follow when devising either static or dynamic graphics."

Julia has been in development for over 11 years. Research on Julia originated at MIT in 2009. Julia is powered by multiple dispatch - a generalization of both, object oriented programming and functional programming. Julia's multiple dispatch makes it easy to write programs at a high level of abstraction while simultaneously getting high performance. This has led to Julia being used by over 10,000 companies and 1,500 universities worldwide. Pumas, developed in Julia, integrates mechanistic pharmacometric models with Scientific Machine Learning and neural networks. In a recent case study, we demonstrated 175x speedup for a QSP workload. Pumas is designed for every type of analysis scientists perform throughout the drug development lifecycle in one seamless environment. Leveraging Julia's parallel capabilities, Pumas leverages distributed computing and GPUs and runs on the cloud through the JuliaHub platform. These workflows leverage the Julia's database, statistics, and visualization functionality in a single package."

As part of characterising these models, DNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics analyses are used systematically to study their genomes. Therefore, large volumes of data are generated and various algorithms are applied to analyse this data, which introduces a challenge on representing all findings in an informative and concise manner. Scientific visualisation can be used to facilitate the explanation of complex genomic editing events such as integration events, deletions, insertions, etc. However, current visualization tools tend to focus on numerical data, ignoring the need to visualise editing events on a larger yet biologically-relevant scale. Thus, we have developed gmoviz, an R package designed to extend traditional bioinformatics workflows used for genomic characterization with powerful visualization capabilities based on the Circos plotting framework. The circular layout used in gmoviz's plots enables users to succinctly display genome-wide information about complex genomic editing events along with contextual biological information to improve the interpretation of findings. The gmoviz package has been developed by utilizing the many features of the Bioconductor ecosystem in order to support several genomic file formats and to seamlessly generate publication-quality figures. Finally, a complex transgenic mouse model, which harbours human gene knock-in, gene knock-outs, segmental insertion, deletion and concatemerisation events, has been used to illustrate the functionality of gmoviz."

Programmers write a lot of reports that describe the results of data analyses. There should be a clear and automatic path from data and code to the final report. R Markdown is ideal for this as it is a system for combining code and text into a single document. It is also an efficient, user-friendly tool for producing reports that do not need constant updating. RStudio is often used in the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare industries for analysis and data visualization, and the R Markdown tool can also be leveraged for creating reports and datasets for submission to regulatory agencies. This paper presents an RStudio program that demonstrates how to use R Markdown to generate a statistical table showing adverse events (AE) by system organ class (or preferred term) and severity grade along with text that explains the table. Collecting AE data and performing analysis of AEs is a common and critical part of Clinical Trials. A well-developed reporting system such as one generated with R Markdown, provides a solid foundation and an efficient approach towards a better understanding of what the data represent."

However, unmeasured confounding stemming from non-randomized treatments and poorly measured comorbidities remains the greatest obstacle to utilizing these data sources for real-world evidence generation. To reduce unmeasured confounding, data-driven algorithms can be used to leverage the large volume of information in healthcare databases to identify proxy variables for confounders that are either unknown to the investigator or not directly measured in these data sources (proxy confounder adjustment). Evidence has shown that data-driven algorithms for proxy confounder adjustment can supplement investigator-specified variables to improve confounding control compared to adjustment based on investigator-specified variables alone. Consequently, there has been a recent explosion in the development of data-driven methods for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment. In this talk, I will discuss recent advancements in data-driven methods for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment and their implementation within the R computing environment. I will discuss challenges in assessing the validity of alternative analytic choices to tailor analyses to the given study to improve validity and robustness when estimating treatment effects in healthcare databases."

The ability to produce tables, listings and figures (TLFs) in customized rich text format (RTF) using R is crucial to enhance the workflow of using Microsoft Word to assemble analysis results. We developed an R package, r2rtf, that standardizes the approach to generate highly customized TLFs in RTF format. The r2rtf package provides flexibility to customize table appearance for table title, subtitle, column header, footnote, and data source. The table size, border type, color, and line width can be adjusted in each cell as well as column width, row height, text format, font size, text color, alignment, etc. The control of the format can be row or column vectorized by leveraging the vectorization in R. Furthermore, r2rtf provides pagination, section grouping, multiple tables concatenations for complicated table layouts. In this paper, we provide an overview r2rtf workflow with examples for both required and optional easy-to-use functions. Code examples are provided to create customized RTF tables and figures with highlighted features. The open-source r2rtf R package is available at https//github.com/Merck/r2rtf."
